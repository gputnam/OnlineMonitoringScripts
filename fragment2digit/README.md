Run the fragment to digit converter. Must be run in an MRB environment
containg the DaqDecoder module. Also must be run in a python environment
containing the dependencies in requirements.txt.

To run, call `python convert_and_store.py`. To configure input file
locations, edit the constants defined at the top of file_handler.py. To
change the input => output file name conversion, see the function at the
top of fragment2digit.py.
